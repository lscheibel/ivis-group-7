2. Depending on your platform download and install `nvm` (OSX, Linux) or `nvm-windows` as described on their GitHub.
3. Use `nvm install 18` to install node.
4. Use `nvm use 18` to use node version 18.
5. Open a terminal in this directory.
6. Use `npm i` to install all dependencies.
7. Use `npm run dev` to start a dev server.
8. You should now be able to go to http://localhost:2345 to see a preview of the app! ðŸŽ‰
