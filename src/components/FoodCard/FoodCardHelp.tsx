            <strong>About this chart:</strong>
            <p>
                The nutrition mix shows the amount of food consumed per capita in grams in the country, focusing solely
                on the age group (15â€“19 years old). It displays the median value in grams consumed per day per person.
                This data is relative to the year 2018 and was downloaded from{' '}
                <a href={'https://globaldietarydatabase.org/'}>Global Dietary Database</a>. The median value means that
                half of the population in that age group consumes more than that value, and the other half consumes
                less.
            </p>
