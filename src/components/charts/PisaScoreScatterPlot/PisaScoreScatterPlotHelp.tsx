            <strong>About this graph:</strong>
            <p>
                This scatter plot shows the correlations between the average PISA score for each country and other
                parameters. The PISA score is graded on a 0-600 scale, with 0 being the worst and 600 being the best
                score possible. Note that only 81 countries/regions of the world total countries took part in the PISA
                study.
